# Nintanium

Nintanium is a fork of [NXNative](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative) (MIT License, kept in [LICENSE](LICENSE)), which turns your own Switch games into iPhone, iPad and Mac apps. It adds a Stretch picture option, cheats on iPhone and iPad, a mods folder for code patches, replacement files and cheats, High frame rate and Ultrawide toggles for such mods, crash reports that name the game's code in `log.txt`, iPhone-only or iPad-only builds, a Mac app that builds and installs games, and tuning for the iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPad Pro (M4) on iOS 27.

## Getting it

Build exactly as [NXNative's README](README.md#how-to-play) says, but clone this repository instead of NXNative:

```
git clone https://github.com/kencalx/Nintanium.git && cd Nintanium
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/MarioWonder -k ~/keys/prod.keys
```

To take in NXNative's newer changes later:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/seedds/nxnative.git   # once
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main
```

## What changes

### Picture: Stretch

The **Picture** setting (start screen and the in-game gear menu) now has **Fit**, **Fill** and **Stretch**:

- **Fit** (default): the whole 16:9 picture, black bars at the sides.
- **Fill**: covers the screen, top and bottom cropped.
- **Stretch** (new): covers the whole screen and crops nothing. The picture is stretched to the screen's shape, so it looks about a fifth wider on an iPhone. The whole HUD stays on screen.

The picture is drawn once, straight at the screen's resolution, so Stretch isn't blurrier than Fit. Touches on the game's touch screen line up with the stretched picture. In portrait and on a TV the picture keeps its shape. `DM_PICTURE_FIT=stretch` in the app's `Documents/env.txt` sets it from a file. MetalFX upscaling applies only to a picture that keeps its shape, so a stretched picture uses standard smooth scaling.

**Picture shape** (Breath of the Wild, Animal Crossing: New Horizons) now starts at the shape nearest your screen: **16:9** on the iPhone 18 Pro Max, whose 2.17:1 screen showed the taller 1.43:1 picture about a fifth smaller in Fit, and the taller **1.43:1** on a 4:3 iPad Pro (and an iPhone Duo). A shape you pick stays yours (on an iPhone, a 1.43:1 picked before this build was the default then and was never saved, so pick it again), and the Mac stays at 16:9.

### The gear appears on a double tap

The gear is hidden while you play: **double-tap** anywhere except on a button, the D-pad or the left stick to show it. It fades out again after 5 seconds if you don't touch it, and stays while its menu is open. It also shows when the game starts, until 5 seconds after its first picture (and after the **Preparing shaders** or **Preparing pipelines** screen of a first start); it stays while VoiceOver or Switch Control is on (turning either on shows it), and while the game shows an offline web page. A double tap on a control counts as two presses, not a request for the menu, so pressing a button twice quickly never brings it up.

### Touch controls, Upscaling and Share log in the gear's menu

- **Touch control size** (new: **Large**, the size they always had, **Medium**, **Small**) and **Touch control opacity** (new: **Faint**, **Light**, **Normal**, the look they always had, **Strong**), on the start screen and in the gear's menu, change the touch controls at once and are remembered. What a touch takes shrinks with the drawing; the right stick, which is not drawn, keeps its swipe length. Small is for the iPhone mainly: an iPad already draws the controls about one and a half times as large, so Small there is about an iPhone's Large. The gear keeps its normal look.
- **Upscaling** (Standard, Automatic, MetalFX) is in the gear's menu too, while you play: the next frame takes it, Automatic counts its 60 frames again, and MetalFX's setup for a picture size is kept, so switching back does not pause again. The game's own upscaler (**Game's upscaler**) stays a start-time setting.
- **Share log** (new), on the start screen and at the bottom of the gear's menu, opens one share sheet with `log.txt`, the previous run's `log.prev.txt` (a run that crashed is that one at the next start), `run_layouts.txt` (where the game's modules were in recent runs, which a crash report needs) and the five newest MetricKit reports in `metrics/`. They are copied first, so the game can go on writing its log; a file that is missing is left out. Nothing is sent unless you pick where it goes.

### Cheats on iPhone and iPad

- The app now has a `cheats` folder in the Files app, under the app's name, with a `README.txt` in it. Put an Atmosphère cheat file there, named after the game's build ID (`0123456789ABCDEF.txt`), or an SD card's `atmosphere/contents/<title ID>/cheats/` folder.
- The in-game gear menu has a new **Cheats** submenu. It lists the cheats by section; tap one to turn it on or off (remembered for the next start). It also has **Cheats on** (all off at once) and **Reload cheats**, so a file you copy in works without restarting. With no file, it shows the build ID the game is looking for.
- Cheats that rewrite the game's code can't run on iPhone or iPad, because the app's code is signed. They show greyed out with the reason. Pack such patches in as code patches instead (below).

### Mods folder (patches, replacement files, cheats)

Make a folder named `mods` inside your game's folder, beside the NSPs, and copy mods in as Atmosphère, yuzu or Ryujinx lay them out. A whole SD card's `atmosphere` folder works too.

```
~/Games/MarioWonder/
  Super Mario Bros. Wonder [010015100B514000][v0].nsp
  mods/
    atmosphere/exefs_patches/60fps/<build ID>.ips       code patch (IPS / IPS32)
    60fps/exefs/60fps.pchtxt                            code patch (IPSwitch text, its @enabled patches)
    atmosphere/contents/010015100B514000/romfs/...      replacement game files
    atmosphere/contents/010015100B514000/cheats/<build ID>.txt
```

The build applies it all:

- **Code patches** (`.ips`, `.ips32`, `.pchtxt`) for the version being packed are written into the game's code before NXNative's rewriter runs. This is how a 60 fps or resolution patch reaches an iPhone.
- **`romfs` folders**: their files replace or add game files in the packed game data. On a Mac's APFS drive this clones the game data instead of copying it.
- **`cheats` folders**: cheat files are packed into the app, which copies each into its `cheats` folder at each start when that folder does not have it (a file already there is kept). A cheat file not named after a build ID counts as the packed version's. A packed file you delete comes back at the next start: to stop its cheats, turn off the Cheats submenu's master switch (**Cheats on**), or set `DM_CHEATS=` in `Documents/env.txt`.

A folder named with a title ID counts for that title and its update (+0x800); other games' folders are skipped. In a game of several programs (Super Mario 3D All-Stars), each program takes only the folders named with its own title ID (the application's + the program's index), and mods outside title folders go to every program. A DLC's folder (the application's title ID + 0x1000 + its index) is not packed: a DLC's game data is not modded, and the report lists the folder as ignored. To turn a mod off without deleting it, rename its folder to start with `-`. `--mods <folder>` uses another folder, and `--no-mods` builds without mods. The console lists what was applied, and `<title ID>_build/mods/<version>.txt` keeps that report. Your extracted game files are never modified: the modded copy is in `<title ID>_build/mods/<version>/` (`--no-keep-extracted` deletes it with them).

Limits:

- If a patch changes an instruction that NXNative's own fixes for that game also change, the rewrite stops with an error naming it. Turn that patch off.
- **Patches only an emulator runs are left out.** Some mods made for emulators put code of their own past the end of the game's code and data (a "code cave"), or jump from the game's code to somewhere that is not code. The iPhone runs only the app's signed code, so such a patch would end the game seconds after it starts (a Switch can't run it either). The build leaves that patch out, whole: one `@enabled` block of a `.pchtxt`, or one `.ips` file. When the block holds the cave and the jump into it beside other changes, only the cave and that jump are left out. The mod's other patches go in, and the report says what was left out and why in a red line. A patch that writes only the game's code and data, and whose jumps stay in its code, goes in exactly as before.
- A `romfs` mod that replaces the game's shader files can fail NXNative's shader checks.

### High frame rate and Ultrawide toggles

A mod whose folder name says it changes the frame rate (`60FPS`, `Frame rate`) or the picture's shape (`Ultrawide`, `21.9`, `21:9`) is no longer written into the game for good. The build packs it so the launcher's **High frame rate** and **Ultrawide** toggles turn it on and off at the next start, without rebuilding. Mods like those of [Switch-Emulator-Ultrawide-FPS-Mods](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174/Switch-Emulator-Ultrawide-FPS-Mods) work as they come, in yuzu's or Ryujinx's layout, but for patches only an emulator runs (below). That repository has no license, so its mods are not included here: copy the ones for your game into its mods folder yourself.

- **One mod per kind.** Of several mods (a pack's 30, 60 and 120 FPS, its 21:9 and 32:9), the build takes 60 fps and the ultrawide shape nearest the iPhone 18 Pro Max's screen, and prefers a mod not made for Ryujinx alone. The report lists the others it left out.
- **Ultrawide on the iPhone.** The mod's aspect value is set to the iPhone 18 Pro Max's screen (2868 x 1320) when the mod keeps it as a number, and the picture is stretched to fill the screen, which is the shape the wider view was drawn for. While Ultrawide stretches the picture, the in-game menu has no **Picture** row: the picture stays at Stretch until Ultrawide is turned off at the next start. On an iPad, whose screen is taller than 16:9, Ultrawide stays off.
- **Games with their own Frame rate setting** (Breath of the Wild, Luigi's Mansion 3 and others) take no frame-rate mod: the launcher's Frame rate already does it, and the two would fight.
- **How it works.** The build rewrites the game's code once more with the mod and keeps only the bytes that change. With both toggles, the two rewrites run at the same time (`DM_VARIANT_J=1` runs them one after another on a Mac short of memory), and a repeat build reuses the bytes it found (`DM_VARIANT_RUNS_CACHE=0` finds them again). On iPhone and iPad, each code page the mod touches is packed as signed code, once with and once without the mod, and the app swaps the page in at start. A mod that changes code NXNative's own fixes also change, or data the game's loader adjusts, can't be switched: the build leaves it out and says why.
- **A mod with a patch only an emulator runs** (Limits, above) is offered without that patch, and the report says so in a red line. With nothing else left, it is not offered. Super Mario Odyssey's `[21.9 Ultrawide Adjusted HUD v1.4.1]` for 1.3.0 to 1.4.1 is such a mod: its Joy-Con fix (for the boot screen's Joy-Con picture) has a code cave, the likely cause of a crash with Ultrawide on ([its note](dm/games/0100000000010000/README.md#mods)). Ultrawide is offered without that fix.
- **FPSLocker** patches (FPSLocker-Warehouse) are a different format, for a system module that changes memory while the game runs. They aren't read. Most of the games they cover already have the launcher's Frame rate.

### Nintanium Builder (Mac app)

[builder/](builder/README.md) is a Mac app that does all of this without the terminal:

- it builds a game's app with the NSP script, for the **iPhone** or the **iPad** (`--device`, below), with its pipelines made ahead of time for that device's GPU (**Pre-compile GPU shaders**, on by default; below);
- it keeps each game's patches and cheats and adds them at build time;
- it installs the app and its game files on the device, signed with your Apple account through Xcode, or as an unsigned IPA for a sideloading tool;
- it pulls this repository's new commits as they are added.

Build it with `builder/make_app.sh`. A damaged NSP, NUP or dump (files that fail their hash check, or `.zs` files that are not zstd) stops the build; the Builder cannot pack such files as they are. Pack again from a good copy, or run `python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py … --allow-damaged` from Terminal.

### Both memory entitlements in every build

Every build, whether the Xcode project or the unsigned IPA, asks for **Increased Memory Limit** and **Extended Virtual Addressing**:
- **Increased Memory Limit** lets the app use more of the device's RAM before iOS closes it.
- **Extended Virtual Addressing** lifts the cap of about 5 to 6 GB that iOS otherwise puts on the app's address space ([memory reference](docs/reference/memory.md)).

An Apple Developer Program team provisions both; a free Personal Team only the first (build with `DM_ENTITLEMENTS=<plist>` holding Increased Memory Limit alone, which Nintanium Builder does when its paid-account setting is off). The log's `boot: memory:` line shows that both are in effect on the device: how much RAM iOS allows the app, and whether an 8 GB address reservation succeeds. The `boot: address space:` line after it gives the largest block of address space the device reserves for the app, and whether the guest blocks of the games that are Mac-only for lack of address space (EA SPORTS FC 27 7 GB; Splatoon Raiders, Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave and Star Fox 21.25 GB; Mario Tennis Fever 25.25 GB) would fit; a block that fits is needed, not enough ([memory reference](docs/reference/memory.md#the-largest-block-of-address-space-a-device-reserves)). The games' memory layouts are their profiles' own, tested within 5 GB, so a game uses more address space only where its profile asks for it.

### Drag Here: build by dropping a folder

`scripts/make_drag_here.sh` makes **Drag Here.app** on your Desktop. Drop a game's folder on it and Terminal opens and runs the build. The folder holds the game's NSPs, and can also hold its `mods` folder and `prod.keys`.

The build it runs:
```
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py "<folder>" -k "<keys>" --device iphone
```
- **The keys** are the first one found: `prod.keys` in the folder, beside it, in `~/.switch/`, or one other `.keys` file in the folder. A dump folder (`base/exefs/main.npdm`, with a RomFS in `base/` or `updates/<version>/`) or a NUP needs no keys.
- **The mods folder** is packed in as usual.
- **Several folders** dropped together are built one after another in one Terminal window; only the last waits for Return at the end. A build that stops leaves its lines there, and the next one starts.
- **The window stays open** at the end so you can read the result.
- **Other devices:** `scripts/make_drag_here.sh ipad` makes an iPad droplet, and `both` makes one for iPhone + iPad builds.
- **A damaged NSP, NUP or dump** stops the build, as in the Builder: the droplet runs no `--allow-damaged`. Pack again from a good copy, or run the command above with `--allow-damaged` from Terminal.

The first drop asks to let it control Terminal: allow it. The droplet runs the build from the checkout you ran `make_drag_here.sh` in, so pulling that checkout updates what it runs. `scripts/drop_build.sh "<folder>"` does the same from Terminal.

### Reading a log: `scripts/devlog.py`

`python3 scripts/devlog.py log.txt` sums up a `log.txt` from the iPhone or iPad (**Share log** sends it): the build and the device's GPU, the switches in effect, how long preparing pipelines took, the frame rate and dropped frames, CPU power per frame, memory over time and its growth per 10 minutes, the display's latency and what happened just before it rose (leaving the app and coming back, a notification), the longest frames and why, audio underruns, saves and the `[RED]` lines. `python3 scripts/devlog.py log.prev.txt log.txt` sets two runs side by side, with what got better or worse; `--json` gives the same for other tools ([Reading a device log](docs/development.md#reading-a-device-log)). It only reads the log: nothing in the app changes.

### iPhone or iPad builds

`--device iphone` or `--device ipad` (`DEVICE` in Spyder) builds an app for that device family only. The pipeline archive (the GPU's own compiled shaders, below) is made for that device's GPU alone: the A20 Pro (`g19p`) or the M4 (`g16g`), rather than both. The Metal shader libraries are the same for every iOS device, so there is no other per-device shader output. An iPad build leaves out the Ultrawide toggle and does not pack the Ultrawide mod (the build says `mods: Ultrawide left out`). Without `--device`, one app serves both, as before.

### Tuned for iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPad Pro (M4) on iOS 27

NXNative already requires an A17 Pro or M1 or later with Metal 4, already drives ProMotion's 120 Hz display link, and already asks for the Increased Memory Limit. On top of that:

- **iOS 27.0 is the minimum, everywhere:** the app, its C and Objective-C, the host's own Metal shaders, every game's shaders (NVN, Vulkan, OpenGL) and the pipeline archives. Support for iOS 26 is dropped.
- **The M4's and A20's CPU:** the app's code is compiled with `-mcpu=apple-m4`. One app runs on both devices, so it can only use instructions both chips have: the M4's, which the newer A20 has in full. In LLVM, the compiler Xcode is built on, `apple-a18` (NXNative's setting) is another name for `apple-m4`, so this produces the same code as before; it names your device. `apple-a20` is another name for the newer `apple-m6` core, which adds instructions the M4 lacks (FP8, PAuth_LR, CPA), and LLVM support for it was only proposed on November 4, 2026, so Xcode 27.2 is unlikely to have it. Older iPhones and iPads (A17 Pro, M1–M3) are no longer a target.
- **The newest Metal Shading Language:** every game's shaders are compiled for iOS 27 in Metal 4.1 (`-std=metal4.1`), which Apple's Metal Shading Language Specification (version 4.1) gives as the language for iOS 27. Upstream named no version, with an iOS 18 minimum, where the language follows the deployment target (Metal 3.2). A shader Metal 4.1 rejects is compiled in Metal 3.2 instead, and the build log names it. This changes NXNative's shader chain version (`dm/gfx/nvn/dmsh_chain.h`), so every game's shaders are compiled again on its next build. The Metal API was already the newest: Metal 4 command queues, compiler, pipeline archives and MetalFX. The translator still writes the same Metal source (MSL 2.3, or 3.1 for image atomics), the version NXNative tests its output in.
- **Swift 6:** the app's Swift (the start screen, the in-game menu) builds in the Swift 6 language mode, with its complete concurrency checks, using the Swift compiler of your Xcode. If a newer compiler finds fault with it, `DM_SWIFT_VERSION=5 python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py …` builds in Swift 5 mode. The Mac app's settings window builds in Swift 6 too (it was Swift 5; `DM_SWIFT_VERSION` is the iPhone app's), for the Mac's minimum macOS. The four Swift functions the C and Objective-C code calls (the start screen, the in-game menu, MetricKit's reports, the Mac's settings window) are `@c @implementation` of one C declaration each, in a header both sides read, so the compiler checks each Swift function against what C calls (Swift 6.3 or later, which Xcode 27.2 has); they were `@_cdecl`, with prototypes nothing compared.
- **Faster host code:** the app's own C and Objective-C (the NVN-to-Metal translator, the encode thread, audio) are built with `-O2` instead of Xcode's size-first `-Os`.
- **Metal 4 pipelines on for every game.** This turns on the pipeline archive, hybrid "stand-in" pipelines and the one-time prebuild. Upstream had it on only for Breath of the Wild on iOS (it was already on for every game on the Mac). The result is fewer first-time stutters. An app carries these pipelines already built for its device's GPU by default (below), so its first start does not wait on **Preparing pipelines**; one built with `--gpu none` waits a few minutes there at its first start (and after each update), once. If a game runs out of memory, turn **Metal 4 pipelines** off for it in the start screen's Performance section.
- **Unreal Engine games** (DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined) get the larger texture streaming pool on iOS too, when the memory has room for it (below), for sharper textures. `DM_UE_TEXTURE_POOL=0` in `Documents/env.txt` restores the game's own.

To get the most out of the two devices:

- **Pipelines made ahead of time for your GPU (on by default).** Every NVN game's app carries its pipelines already compiled into GPU code for the device it is built for, made on your Mac by Apple's `metal-tt`: the A20 Pro (`g19p`) for `--device iphone`, the M4 (`g16g`) for `--device ipad`, both for an app for both. Its first start skips **Preparing pipelines** (Breath of the Wild: 0.53 s instead of 7–8 minutes). The cost, per GPU, grows with the game's shaders: time added to a game's first build (later builds reuse it) and size added to the app. Breath of the Wild: about 4 minutes on an M2 Max and 650 MB. Super Mario Odyssey: about 9 minutes on an 8 GB M2 and about 1 GB (measured for its Mac app). A game with very many shader pairs can take an hour or more: for Mario Party Superstars (140,036 pairs) `metal-tt` failed after 76 minutes, and the build then packs the app without the archive. `--gpu none` leaves it out (Nintanium Builder's **Pre-compile GPU shaders** toggle, per game, passes it when off); `DEVICE_GPUS = 'none'` at the top of `scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py` goes back to NXNative's rule, an archive only for the games whose profile sets `pso_mtl4 on` (Breath of the Wild, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which crashed on an A20 Pro without one). Vulkan and OpenGL games have no such archive. Each device prints its GPU's name in `log.txt` at first start (an M4 reports `applegpu_g16g`).
  - **If it crashes, the app works around it by itself.** This was opt-in before: a bundled archive (for the A19 Pro, `g18p`) crashed Metal at boot on an iPhone Air with iOS 27.0, cause unknown ([NX2Apple#640](https://github.com/LNPANDY/NX2Apple/issues/640)), and such a game crashed at every start. Now, if a start with the archive does not get past its first seconds while the app is in front (it crashed, or iOS ended it), the next start leaves the archive out and builds the pipelines on the device instead (**Preparing pipelines**, once), and `log.txt` says why in a red line.
  - **What happens next.** If that start runs, the archive stays out for that build of the app and that iOS version. If it crashes too, the archive was not the cause and is used again. A game whose profile sets `pso_mtl4 on` (Breath of the Wild, which always had its archive; 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which crashed on an A20 Pro without it) keeps it after one such start and leaves it out only after two in a row. Leaving the app or going to the home screen during the first seconds does not count; swiping it away in the app switcher should not count either (the app is told it is no longer active first), but that is not yet checked on a device.
  - **What it cannot tell.** A game that needs its archive and crashes without it only after the first seconds would lose its archive after such a wrong verdict, and then crash at every start. That takes two early ends in a row for a `pso_mtl4 on` game, and one for any other (such a game, if there is one, crashed without the archive before this default too). Deleting `pso_bundle_guard.tsv` brings the archive back.
  - **Trying it again.** An iOS update, or an app built with a changed archive or host (new shaders, a Nintanium update of the app's code), tries the archive again. An app rebuilt from the same game and the same Nintanium is the same app to the guard and keeps the record. To try the archive again at once, delete `pso_bundle_guard.tsv` in the app's folder (Files app), or put `DM_PSO_BUNDLE_GUARD=0` in `Documents/env.txt`. The guard runs on the iPhone and iPad only; Mac apps use their archive as before.
- **Upscaling: Automatic** (new) uses MetalFX only when the game's picture is smaller than 1920x1080, such as handheld mode's 1280x720, and smooth scaling at 1080p or more (MetalFX starts after 60 frames below 1080p, and a 1080p picture is scaled smoothly at once: a switch to docked prepares nothing, and a switch back to handheld reuses MetalFX's setup once it has been made). It is a good fit for both devices: the sharpness where the picture is smallest, without MetalFX's GPU cost on a picture that is already 1080p. On the iPad Pro, plain **MetalFX** is also worth trying: the M4 has the GPU time for it on the 13" screen. Both step back to smooth scaling while the device is hot or in Low Power Mode.
- **Frame buffering** (Performance section) holds a steadier frame rate in heavy games, at the cost of about one frame of input latency. It stays a per-game choice.

### Vulkan games: a pipeline archive to measure (`DM_VK_ARCHIVE=1`)

Vulkan games compile their pipelines at every start: Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 build 4,535 behind "Initializing system...", Hades 1,856 before its first frame. NVN games keep theirs in a pipeline archive (above); Vulkan games had none, and nobody has measured whether Metal's own shader cache already makes a second start fast. Two things are new:

- **The `[vk] pipelines:` line in `log.txt`** also says how long the compiles spent at Metal's compiler, how much of that went on specializing the shaders, the same since the start, and when the burst ended, counted from the game's Vulkan device (made when the game starts) and from the app's start (which includes the time on the start screen): `…; 4535 since the start; 9.00 s at Metal's compiler summed, 2.0 ms each, 1.50 s of it specializing (since the start 9.00 s, 1.50 s of it specializing); the burst ended 6.50 s after the Vulkan device was made, 41.20 s after the process started`.
- **`DM_VK_ARCHIVE=1`** in `Documents/env.txt` (new, off by default) keeps the compiled pipelines in Metal binary archives in `Documents/vk_archive`, written in the background once a burst of compiles has ended and when you leave the app, and used from the next start on: Metal takes a pipeline it finds there instead of compiling it, and compiles one it does not exactly as without the switch. An iOS or app update, another game version or new shaders start the archive over. A start with it that crashes in its first seconds makes the next start run without it, as the bundled NVN archive's crash guard does (delete `vk_archive/guard.tsv` to try it again, or set `DM_VK_ARCHIVE_GUARD=0`). The line then ends `; pipeline archive (DM_VK_ARCHIVE): H of them in its keys, A ms each at the compiler, the other M B ms each (since the start …); W waiting to be added`. "In its keys" counts the pipelines the archive was given, not the ones Metal took from it: only the times show that. At the start `log.txt` says `[vk] pipeline archive …: N files, P pipelines, S MB, opened in T ms` (or `none yet`); after each write it says `[vk] pipeline archive: N pipelines added in …, written to p00000.bin, … MB, …; C compiles began during it; …`, and once everything is written `[vk] pipeline archive: all written, nothing waiting`. Off, nothing of it runs. Details: [rendering reference](docs/reference/rendering.md#a-pipeline-archive-for-the-vulkan-layer-opt-in).

**What to measure**, on the iPhone 18 Pro Max and the iPad Pro M4, with Super Mario Galaxy (or Galaxy 2, or Hades). Each start: open the game, let it reach the title screen and wait 10 s more, then send `log.txt` with **Share log** in the gear's menu (or leave the app and copy it from the Files app); keep each under its letter. All five starts are needed: E is the only one that shows whether Metal takes the pipelines from the archive, since in D Metal's own cache is warm as well.

1. **A, cold, without the archive.** Back up the game's `save` folder in the Files app if it matters, delete the app (that empties Metal's own cache for it) and install it again. Start it once: `A.txt`.
2. **B, warm, without the archive.** Start it again: `B.txt`.
3. **C, with the archive, writing it.** Put `DM_VK_ARCHIVE=1` in `Documents/env.txt`. Start it: the boot is as warm as B, then the archive is written. Wait for the line `[vk] pipeline archive: all written, nothing waiting` (Share log shows the log so far; if it is missing, leave the game running a minute, or go to the home screen and back, which also writes): `C.txt`. Stopping earlier leaves part of the boot out of the archive, and D and E then find fewer pipelines in it.
4. **D, warm, with the archive.** Start it again: `D.txt`. Its start line says `N files, P pipelines`.
5. **E, cold, with the archive.** Copy `Documents/vk_archive` and `Documents/env.txt` out with the Files app, delete the app and install the same IPA again, copy both back before the first start, then start it: `E.txt`. Its start line must say `N files, P pipelines` again (not `made for another …`, which means the archive was started over).

Then run `grep '\[vk\] pipelines:' A.txt B.txt C.txt D.txt E.txt` (or search each for `[vk] pipelines:`). A boot can be split over several such lines, so in each file take the first line whose `K since the start` reaches the boot's count (4,535 for Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2, 1,856 for Hades); its `since the start` figures and its `the burst ended … s after the Vulkan device was made` cover the whole boot. Compare:

- **B against A:** what Metal's own cache already saves.
- **D against B:** what the archive adds while Metal's cache is warm.
- **E against A:** whether Metal takes the pipelines from the archive at all, both starts with Metal's cache empty. If it does, E's time at Metal's compiler is close to D's and far below A's; if E's is close to A's, it does not.
- **In D and E,** the archive part's `since the start H', A' ms each, and M', B' ms each`: the pipelines in its keys against the others.
- **If D or E is not clearly faster,** `of it specializing`: the shaders' specializations, which the archive does not keep, against the pipeline states.
- **C:** what writing costs, from the `added in … s` and `MB` of its write lines, and how many compiles ran during each write (`compiles began during it`).

The archive becomes the default only if B still spends seconds and D clearly less, and E shows that Metal takes the pipelines from it. On the Mac the same works with `DM_VK_ARCHIVE=1` in the environment or in the Mac app's `env.txt` in `~/Library/Application Support/nxnative/<title ID>/`; Metal's own cache is emptied there by removing `$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)com.apple.metal` (every app's, which each builds again).

### HMMA self-test (`DM_SELFTEST=hmma`)

`DM_SELFTEST=hmma` checks, on the device's own GPU, the `simdgroup_matrix` body that the shader build writes for Ampere's HMMA.16816 instructions (agl's upscaler networks, Donkey Kong Bananza's NDSR, Ocarina of Time's movie networks), compiled exactly as that platform's game shaders are: the calls the translator gives no flag, and in a second kernel the calls with its flags (accumulators kept between calls, a call in no chain while they are kept, A kept, C = 0, A loaded from shared memory where an LDSM read it). No game with HMMA runs on iOS yet, so this measures the body ahead of time. The body differs from NXNative's in one place: a call in no chain works in two matrices of its own, where NXNative's works it in slot 0's and overwrites the sum of a chain open there ([HMMA chains keep their matrices in the SIMD-group](docs/reference/shaders.md#hmma-chains-keep-their-matrices-in-the-simd-group)). Any game's IPA built from this tree carries the test. Details: [GPU self-tests](docs/development.md#gpu-self-tests).

**On the iPhone 18 Pro Max and the iPad Pro M4:**

1. Install an IPA of any game built from this tree.
2. In the Files app, add the line `DM_SELFTEST=hmma` to `Documents/env.txt` (create the file if it is missing; one `KEY=VALUE` a line).
3. Start the game with **Play**. The test runs once before the game's first instruction, so the game may start a moment later than usual (at most 20 s).
4. Use **Share log** and find the two lines with `self-test hmma:` in `log.txt`, one for each kernel.
5. Remove the line from `env.txt` afterwards (or set it to `0`).

**On an Apple-silicon Mac** (an M6 has the A20 Pro's family, Apple11): run `python3 -m unittest -v dm/gfx/tests/test_dmsh_hmma.py`. It prints `macOS chain: …`, `iOS chain on the macosx SDK: …`, `macOS chain, flagged calls: …` and `iOS chain on the macosx SDK, flagged calls: …`, each with a `compiled by:` line; `flagged run, iOS chain on the macosx SDK: …` (NXNative's own run of flagged calls, compiled with the iOS chain's flags); then `iOS chain, hmma_selftest: compiled by …` and `iOS chain, hmma_selftest_flags: compiled by …` (compiled only).

**Reading the lines:**

- `<GPU> (<architecture>, highest Apple family N)`: for example `applegpu_g19p` and 11 on the A20 Pro, `applegpu_g16g` and 9 on the M4.
- `worst output at W% of its bound`: how close the worst of the 1,048,576 outputs (256 tiles, four chained calls a lane, eight runs) came to its own bound, 0.01 + 0.4 % of its value. This is the number to read. On these inputs a CPU model that rounds once comes to about 9 %, one that rounds the F16 accumulator after every step of k to about 62 %.
- The second line, `256 tiles x 8 flagged calls (…)`: `worst result at W% of its bound` is the same number for the calls with the translator's flags. Only each chain's end is seen, so a result's bound is the single call's added up along its chain. On these inputs a CPU model that rounds once a call comes to about 7 %, one that rounds after every step of k to about 39 %.
- `: ok` at the end: every output within its bound, every run the same.
- `[RED] self-test hmma: … OVER BOUND (…)`: the body is outside the bound on this GPU. `[RED] self-test hmma: … RUNS DIFFER (…)`: the same input gave another result in another run. Send that log.
- `compiled by …`: the commands that made the kernel, so the line shows whether the device measured Metal 4.1 or the fallback language.
- `[RED] self-test hmma: … not run: <why>` (`… flagged calls: not run: <why>` for the second kernel): it could not run (the host was built without the kernel, the library did not load, the pipeline failed, the GPU's SIMD-groups are not 32 lanes, or the command buffer failed). `[RED] self-test: not finished after 20 s`: the game started without waiting for it.

**What to send back:** the two `self-test hmma:` lines from the iPhone and from the iPad, and the Mac test's printed lines.

### Memory, CPU/GPU scheduling and heat

A check of these areas found NXNative already well tuned: Metal 4 residency sets, upload staging capped per batch, unmapped guest memory released at once, textures kept lossless-compressed unless a view needs otherwise, ProMotion asked for 60 Hz (30 for a 30 fps target) rather than 120, pipeline building on background (utility) queues, the game's and audio's threads at user-interactive priority, and a 30 fps hold for games whose speed the host controls while iOS reports serious heat. Added, none of which changes what a game sees or how fast it runs:

- **MetalFX steps aside when hot.** With **Upscaling: MetalFX** or **Automatic** on, the app scales smoothly instead while the device is thermally serious or in Low Power Mode, and MetalFX comes back after 30 s of calm. This is for every game, including those whose frame rate the host does not control. `DM_THERMAL_CAP=0` keeps MetalFX.
- **The frame-rate counter says so** (new). While heat or Low Power Mode holds the frame rate at 30 (60 for a game at 120) or keeps MetalFX off, a line under the counter's number shows a thermometer and **Hot**, or a battery and **Low Power**, then **30 fps cap**, **no MetalFX** or both. The host only writes two values when they change and the counter reads them once a second, so it costs nothing per frame; with the counter off, nothing shows.
- **Memory warnings are logged and acted on.** iOS's memory warning, the last notice before it ends an app for memory, now writes the footprint and the room left to `log.txt`, and the app hands its allocators' free pages back to the system.
- **The game's drawables are render targets only.** The iOS game layer's drawables are now only drawn into (`framebufferOnly`, as on the Mac), which lets Core Animation and Metal keep them in the form best for display (lossless compression). The game never sees them, so how it runs is unchanged; `DM_DRAWABLE_SHADER_ACCESS=1` in `Documents/env.txt` restores the old setting. The saving is not measured.
- **The larger Unreal texture pool only with room to spare:** on iOS it applies when at least the pool plus 2 GB is left before the memory limit at the game's first present (checked once); otherwise the game keeps its own pool.
- **Texture-upload staging given back after loading.** The staging a loading screen grows (up to 192 MB, counted in the app's memory on iOS) goes back to 4 MB per upload slot once a slot has gone 600 submissions and 20 s without needing more, after its last upload has finished on the GPU; the next burst allocates again. This leaves more room under the memory limit for the large games. `DM_UPLOAD_TRIM=0` keeps it for the whole run. The saving is not measured.

Changed, the frame rate in Low Power Mode (the game's speed stays the same):

- **Low Power Mode holds 30 fps for frame-step games** (Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Age of Calamity, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Astral Chain), and 60 for a game the host lets run at 120, as the heat cap already did: you chose battery over speed, and the clocks are lower in it anyway. The frame rate comes back 30 s after Low Power Mode is turned off. Other games are not affected. `DM_LOW_POWER_CAP=0` in `Documents/env.txt` keeps the chosen frame rate; `DM_THERMAL_CAP=0` turns off the heat cap too.

Left alone, because each could change how a game runs and needs a measurement on your devices first:

- **`DM_QOS_MAP=1`** lets low-priority game threads run on the efficiency cores, which could save power. NXNative keeps it off until a phone test shows it drops no frames. Try it per game in `Documents/env.txt` and compare the `[nvn] on-screen` lines in `log.txt`.
- **Freeing compiled shaders and pipelines under memory pressure:** in-flight pipelines point at them directly, and rebuilding them would bring back stutters.
- **A 30 Hz display for every 30 fps game:** games that time themselves on vsync would run at half speed.
- **Frame buffering** for every game: steadier frame rates for one frame of input latency. It stays a per-game choice in the start screen.
- **NVN's depth bounds test on the GPU (`DM_DEPTH_BOUNDS=1`, new, off by default).** Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom and Pokémon Scarlet call it, most likely to limit their lights, and the host has always dropped it. Metal runs it on Apple10-or-later GPUs only: the iPhone 18 Pro Max's A20 Pro should be one (A19 and M5 are), the iPad Pro's M4 is not, and there the switch changes nothing. It may save GPU time in those games' lighting passes, and it changes what is drawn, so it needs a look and a measurement first (`DM_DEPTH_BOUNDS=ab` with `DM_AB=300` alternates it for the `[ab]` lines; [rendering](docs/reference/rendering.md#nvns-depth-bounds-test-on-an-apple10-gpu-opt-in)).
- **Preparing in the background (`DM_BG_PREPARE=1`, new, off by default).** **Preparing shaders** and **Preparing pipelines** go on while you're in another app, shown in a Live Activity where you can cancel it (iOS 26 and later; no GPU work in the background). Off until it is measured on the devices: the app then keeps running in the background for as long as the step lasts.

### Faster repeat builds

A build of a game that was built before redoes less, with the same app as a result:

- **The iOS shaders stay reused** after an edit of a game profile's notes or test tables (README.md, bench.tsv, smoke.tsv and the like) or a game.tsv key the shaders do not read; only what the shader chain reads from the profile counts (Breath of the Wild: about 100 s saved, and the shader folder is not compressed again). `DM_SHADER_KEY_ALL_PROFILE=1` keys every profile file, as before.
- **Xcode builds only what changed.** `dm/ios/Gen` is no longer deleted and written again: only the files whose bytes changed are replaced, the Xcode project is generated only when its inputs changed, and the executable is signed in a copy of the app. A repeat build of the same game then assembles, links and signs nothing, and the IPA packer reuses the executable's compressed bytes. `DM_GEN_REUSE=0` and `DM_SIGN_REUSE=0` restore the old way. On a drive that is not APFS, the signed copy takes as much space again as the app.
- **The High frame rate and Ultrawide rewrites** run at the same time and keep the bytes they found (above).

### Privacy: nothing leaves the device

The app sends no telemetry: no analytics, no crash reporting, and no network code but the web viewer of a game's offline pages (manuals, help). Games' own reports to Nintendo (`nn::prepo` play reports) are answered by the host, which sends nothing (`hle_offline.c`). The one path left open is closed here: a game's offline page could load an image, a script or a fetch from the internet (a tracking pixel, an analytics script); a WebKit content rule list now blocks every `http(s)` and `ws(s)` load of such a page, as navigations away from it already were.

Kept, because they stay on the device and help when something goes wrong:
- **`log.txt`:** every 5 seconds a few lines on frame times, memory, power and pipelines. It is written in the app's Documents folder, replaced at each start (the previous one is `log.prev.txt`) and never sent anywhere. The sampling is a few system queries every 5 seconds, and part of it feeds the frame-rate statistics.
- **The notification prompt:** only for games of several programs (Super Mario 3D All-Stars), for the local "Tap to start" note when one program starts another.
- **MetricKit's reports** (new), which iOS collects itself (crashes, hangs, a run ended for going over the memory limit, daily performance metrics), are only written into the app's `Documents/metrics` folder, for you to read or attach to a bug report: such an end leaves no line in `log.txt`, and the next start's `log.txt` names its report. The app sends them nowhere, and `DM_METRICS=0` turns this off. Whether iOS shares them with developers is the system's own **Share With App Developers** setting, which the app does not touch.
- **A crash summary in `log.txt`** (new): iOS names the game's code in a crash report only by addresses, which change from run to run, so each start writes where the game's modules are to `Documents/run_layouts.txt` (the newest 8 runs, a small text file, written once per start on a background queue before the game's code runs). When a crash report arrives, `log.txt` gets lines starting `[RED] front end: crash:`: the exception and signal by name, the crashed thread's newest frames with the game's as `main+0x…` and the part of the module they are in, and, if that run had the High frame rate or Ultrawide mod in place, which one to turn off first. `python3 scripts/crashlog.py <report>.json [run_layouts.txt | log.txt]` prints the same on a computer, and from a log of another run it works the module bases out from the report where it can, saying they are inferred and what it cannot tell ([crash reports](docs/reference/memory.md#an-iphone-crash-report-names-the-games-frames-only-by-their-addresses)). Nothing a game sees changes.

### Cloud saves after picking another folder

Pick another **Cloud saves** folder (in the iPhone launcher, or in the Mac settings window) and the next start now treats it as a first sync with that folder:

- **A folder with no save of the game** gets this device's save at that start. Before, a save unchanged since its last sync went there only after the game saved again, though the log said `it goes to the cloud`.
- **A folder that holds another device's save** is compared by date: the newer save wins and the other is kept in the backups (`<date> local` or `<date> cloud`). Before, a save unchanged on this device let the other one in without comparing (this device's was kept as a backup). A game that has not synced since the update still does that once, since its `<save>.sync` does not say which folder it was in step with.
- **A save whose file was removed from iCloud Drive** goes back at the next start, and the log says it is no longer in the cloud.

`<save>.sync` now names the cloud file beside the hash of the save last in step with it. An older build reads the new file as before, and this one takes an older build's file as that build did, then adds the line at its first sync. The push of an unchanged save to a new folder is kept in memory, and `<save>.sync` changes only once the save has gone: a push that does not go out (the app killed, the folder not writable) is decided again at the next start, and a later send of that start goes only while the folder is as the start found it, so a save another device sent there meanwhile is left for the next start to compare, not replaced by this device's unchanged one. A folder path that reads differently at a later start (say a bookmark resolving to another spelling of the same folder) costs only the shortcut once: two saves that differ are compared by date, the loser is kept, and nothing is lost. A cloud file that cannot be read (damaged, or written by a newer build) is still replaced only by a save that has changed. Nothing a game sees changes ([reference](docs/reference/services.md#cloud-saves-after-another-folder-is-picked-or-after-the-clouds-file-is-removed)).

### The Mac app's log when it starts with its error output closed

A Mac app started with its error output closed (a shell's `2>&-`) opened its log on that very descriptor, moved it onto the outputs and then closed it, so the launcher's and the host's error lines were lost or went into the next file opened. The launcher now keeps the log there. A start from Finder, the Dock, `open` or a terminal has all its outputs open and is unchanged ([reference](docs/reference/packing.md#the-mac-apps-log-lines-go-into-another-file-when-it-starts-with-its-error-output-closed)).

### Fixes from the first Mac test run

The first run of the device-test checklist's Mac parts (2026-11-07, on 259c5c8f) found four faults. None of them is in a game's path:

- **`t_fuse_check`** failed 2 of its 10 checks since the NXNative merge: a submission now copies the bound render targets into the queue's own storage (`rt_preserve_bound`), and the test still compared the target's address. It now compares the target's serial, as NXNative's 362f7725 does (taken ahead of the next merge).
- **`t_feedback`** failed one check in about 1 run in 13 (`two reports in one command buffer read two times`). In the graphics tests the guest clock is a stub that returns 0, so neither report took its boundary's GPU time: both took the CPU clock in the completion handler and could read the same microsecond. The host now converts the boundaries' GPU timestamps through one pair of clock samples per submission (`rep_ticks`), on the guest clock or, in the tests, the monotonic clock, and the test checks each report against its own boundary's GPU timestamp, with equal times allowed as NVN allows them. In a game the only change is that one pair is sampled per submission instead of one per report, so a submission's reports keep their GPU order and spacing ([reference](docs/reference/frame-rate.md#the-gpu-idles-with-the-next-command-buffer-already-committed)).
- **`make -C dm/gfx/tests`** kept a `game_profile.h` written by an older `game.py`, so on a Mac that had built a game before b1d7c707 the tests did not compile (`use of undeclared identifier 'DM_GAME_DRAW_BARRIERS_GAME'`). The tests now remake it through the host Makefile on every make, as the host and its own tests do; an unchanged header rebuilds no test.
- **The shader split** raised `struct.error` on an NDSR pack shorter than 0x114 bytes, which the nightly fuzz job found. It now scores only whole records, as NXNative's ff33639c does (taken ahead of the next merge). No known game has such a pack, and no game's split changes ([reference](docs/reference/shaders.md#the-ndsr-packs-record-start)).

## Testing status

These changes are written on Linux. GitHub's Mac runners (Xcode 27, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`) compile them on every push: the Mac host for an NVN, a Vulkan and an OpenGL game, every gfx test, the iOS host sources for the iPhone SDK, and the unsigned iOS app (its Objective-C, C and Swift, linked). They run the tool tests, the host's unit tests and the CPU-only gfx tests, with sanitizers. The runners' virtual Macs have no Metal 4, so tests that draw run only on an Apple-silicon Mac (`make -C dm/gfx/tests GAME=<id> run`). Nintanium Builder (`builder/`) is compiled by its own workflow (`.github/workflows/builder.yml`) when it changes.

- **Tested:** the Python side (mods folder, patch formats, the patches only an emulator runs left out, game-data overlay, cheat packing, the switchable mods' selection, byte diff and packed pages, the build script's stages, settings and docs checks, the IPA packer's reuse and parallel deflate, the pipeline archive's default, the touch control and Picture shape rows, the in-game menu's wiring, the log reader `devlog.py` against the host's own format strings) passes NXNative's test suite and this fork's tests. The in-game menu's Upscaling pick (`t_upscale_pick`) and the counter's heat mark (`t_power_mark`), plain C, pass on Linux with clang and gcc, the pick also under gcc's ThreadSanitizer and AddressSanitizer (`make live-menu`, added to CI). The pipeline archive's crash guard (`t_pso_guard`, plain C) passes on Linux with clang and gcc, also under gcc's ThreadSanitizer and AddressSanitizer; it is added to CI (`tests.yml`), not yet run there. The HMMA self-test's two kernels (their source is the shader build's own `hmma_msl` output, compiled with each platform's game shader flags), the wiring of its switch and the shared CPU reference of `mma.m16n8k16` (built with gcc and clang on Linux, checked against PTX's fragment layout) pass `test_dmsh_hmma.py` and `test_host_msl.py` here, the latter with a stand-in Metal compiler; the reference's verdicts on CPU models of the matrix unit (four chained calls a lane; eight calls with the translator's flags, one model whose first call does not load A from shared memory and one of NXNative's body, whose call in no chain overwrites slot 0's chain; eight runs) are checked there too, and so is what each flagged call reads where. The Vulkan pipeline archive's plain C (`t_vk_archive`: its keys, stamp, shader library identity and folder, the gate between its writes and the compiles, its crash guard's use) and the compile times and archive hits of the `[vk] pipelines` line (`t_vk_pending`) pass on Linux with clang and gcc, also under gcc's ThreadSanitizer and AddressSanitizer, and its wiring passes `test_vk_archive_wiring.py`; `make vk-archive` is added to CI, not yet run there.
- **Run on a device (reported):**
  - 2026-11-05, build 31703df5, iPhone 18 Pro Max: Luigi's Mansion 3 with an ultrawide mod's Ultrawide toggle; Persona 5 Royal at 60 fps with `DM_PRESENT_INTERVAL=display` in `Documents/env.txt`; the Stretch and Automatic upscaling options; both memory entitlements (`boot: memory:`).
  - 2026-11-06, build c886066f (after the NXNative merge of shader libraries as one file), iPhone 18 Pro Max: Persona 4 Golden twice (60 fps, the pipeline archive reused on the second start, the Fill / Fit / Stretch picture from the in-game menu, Frame buffering on), and Luigi's Mansion 3 at 60 fps with Ultrawide on and Frame buffering off. The GPU line reads `Apple A20 Pro GPU, architecture applegpu_g19p: highest Apple GPU family Apple11`.
- **Run on a Mac (reported):** 2026-11-07, build 259c5c8f, MacBook Pro with an M4 Max (an Apple9 GPU), macOS 27.3, Xcode 27.3 beta: its Metal compiler 32023.925, with `--allow-other-metal` for the game builds (CI and `dmsh_chain.lock` have Xcode 27.2's 32023.922). Passed: the macOS jobs of `tests.yml` run on that Mac, except the toolchain step's Metal check, which stops on any compiler but the lock's; lint-c; the host's media tests (VP9 in VideoToolbox, AAC 5.1); the iOS compile check and smoke build; the Swift 6 builds; the GPU half of `test_dmsh_hmma.py` with both chains' flags (worst output at 62% of its bound, 39% for the flagged calls); the gfx tests, among them `t_thermal.c`, `t_upload_slots.m`, `t_depth_bounds.m` (only its below-Apple10 path), `t_vk_pso.m`, `t_sampler_family.m`, `t_present_crop.m` and the crash guard's case in `t_pso_bundle.m`, all but `t_fuse_check` and `t_feedback` ([fixed](#fixes-from-the-first-mac-test-run), the fixes not yet run on a Mac); the Luigi's Mansion 3 (iPhone and iPad) and Super Mario Odyssey builds, with no shader falling back to Metal 3.2, and a repeat Luigi's Mansion 3 build in 5 s against 4 min 26 s. Those IPAs are not yet run on a device.
- **Not run on a device yet:** Touch control size and opacity, Upscaling from the gear's menu, the counter's heat / Low Power mark, Share log and the Picture shape default (the Swift is compiled by CI only, and `launcher_storage_check.swift` is not run; the Mac checks in `t_present_crop.m` and `t_thermal.c` passed on the Mac, above); Persona 5 Royal's launcher **Frame rate** row (`present_interval_choice`); an app built with the patches only an emulator runs left out (Super Mario Odyssey's Ultrawide pack, now offered without its Joy-Con fix), and the Mac's switchable mods read whole (`dm/host/mod_rows.h`, compiled and tested on Linux); a Vulkan or OpenGL game with this fork's concurrent Vulkan pipeline compiles (`DM_VK_PSO_ASYNC`) and the GL pipeline-build counts; the Vulkan pipeline archive (`DM_VK_ARCHIVE=1`) and its crash guard, on a Mac too: whether Metal takes its pipelines, what a write costs and the five starts above; the crash summary in `log.txt` and `run_layouts.txt` (written from Super Mario Odyssey's Ultrawide crash report, read by hand; the summary, the record and `scripts/crashlog.py` are tested on Linux with synthetic reports); the iPad Pro M4; the pipeline archive's crash guard on a device (a start with the archive that crashes, then the next start without it); the HMMA self-test (`DM_SELFTEST=hmma`, [GPU self-tests](docs/development.md#gpu-self-tests)) on any GPU, so the body's error on an Apple11 GPU (the A20 Pro) is still unmeasured (the GPU half of `test_dmsh_hmma.py` ran on an M4 Max, above); cloud saves with another folder picked, on either device (`t_save_sync` and `t_save_sync_metadata` pass on Linux with stand-ins for the macOS calls they use, plainly and under ASan, UBSan and TSan, and CI runs them on macOS), and the Mac app started with its error output closed (its case in `test_nsp_mac_app.py` runs only on macOS, in CI).
- **Not measured:** most speed-ups and savings. They follow from what the code does; the device logs above are the only frame-time, power and memory numbers so far, and the Mac's builds above the only build times.
